# The power of open science *(template for you to play with)*

These [Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CsoBX3LwU8r5_34nuzthO9bn8xLxZMmL6-uY-yUaRTs/edit?usp=sharing) are from a 60-minute guest lecture about open science, the Ocean Health Index, and Openscapes. The audience was Professor Claudia Tyler's Conservation Ecology EEMB 168 course at UCSB on March 7, 2019.

Here is a table with some collaborators *(tables use `|`s and `-`s to separate columns and rows)*:


Name | Twitter | GitHub
-----|---------|--------
Jamie | [@jafflerbach](https://twitter.com/jafflerbach) | [@jafflerbach](https://github.com/jafflerbach)
Melanie |  | [@Melsteroni](https://github.com/Melsteroni)

Have you noticed the `[]()` pattern to make links in Markdown? Put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. 

I also talked about GitHub for science â€“ and can include an image with the same format, but note the preceding exclamation point: `![]()` (From the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url).

Can you see our planet? 

[This](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/pia17171.html) is an article talking about this famous picture taken from Cassini. The photograph above is called 'The Day the Earth Smiled'.

Here are some of my favorite planets:

Name | Position from the Sun | Why do I like it?
-----|-----------------------|------------------
Saturn | 6 | Cool rings
Neptune | 7 | Blue Blue Blue!!!
Mars | 4 | It's red!
Earth | 3 | Our home
Venus | 2| Why don't you like Venus???

I formatted my plain text table using `|---|----|`
